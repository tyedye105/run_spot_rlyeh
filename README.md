# Current Version 0.0.1
# Description
Run Spot Ryleh is a text adventure game created using C# and unity.  This was originally was the just Text Based Adventure Game tutorial from the "Learn to Code by Making Games-Complete C#/Unity" class by Ben Tristem on Udemy. However it quickly evolved from just following along in the tutorial as I decided to elaborate upon it by adding some varibality to some scenes ( The text of the game the player reads to play the game.) through items and scenes the player might not interact it with.
